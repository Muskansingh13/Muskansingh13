[cite_start]I am a dedicated Electronics and Communication Engineering student at MMMUT, Gorakhpur with a strong passion for embedded systems and the Internet of Things (IoT)[cite: 4, 49, 86]. [cite_start]My practical experience is highlighted by my project internship at **DEAL, DRDO**, where I developed a real-time satellite communication antenna system using a BeagleBone Black[cite: 5, 9, 11, 58, 60, 63]. [cite_start]I am proficient in writing custom drivers for communication protocols like UART, GPIO, and PWM from scratch using bare-metal C programming[cite: 12, 50, 64].

[cite_start]I am actively seeking to leverage my strong foundation in ARM-based microcontrollers and real-time systems to contribute to a challenging fresher embedded engineer role[cite: 51].

- [cite_start]🌱 I’m currently developing an **Advanced Self-Checkout System** featuring object identification and an RFID-based payment system[cite: 18, 20, 70, 72].
- [cite_start]🔭 My core interests include Embedded Systems, IoT, VLSI, and Robotics[cite: 84].
